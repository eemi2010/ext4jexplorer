	<p class="doc_text">
		When it comes to HTML5 based Rich Internat Applications Sencha's<span class="emph"> Ext JS </span>is definetly one the richest and most 
		powerful library on the market.
		<br/><br/>
		 At <a href="www.nttdata.com/europe">NTT DATA</a> we have been writing big scale J2EE applications with EXT JS 
		as the framework of choice for the UI for years now. Even though we were always able to get things done, there is one thing we could'nt deny : 
		<span class="emph">JavaScript is a nightmare when it comes to big scale applications!</span>.  
		<br/><br/>
		 This is not an attempt to diss JavaScript! With HTML5 becoming stronger everyday we all know
		 that there is no way around JavaScript for applications distributed through the browser. But these are facts
		 that can't by denied and no JS library(not even EXT JS) can't fix: 
		 <br/><br/>
		 - <span class="emph">Compile time errors</span>
		 <br/>
		 Being able to catch errors at compile time rather then runtime is capital for any project(specially big scale one).
		 For someone who makes a lot of typos(like myself) a big time saver and productivity booster
		 		 <br/><br/>
		 - <span class="emph">Tooling a.k.a IDE Support</span>
		 <br/>
		 JavaScript tooling has gotten better and better over the time. IDEs like Aptana and JetBrain have made is enjoyable to write JavaScript code.
		 Sencha just released a set of tools to make EXT JS development easier. But real software development goes beyond autocompletion and content assist.<br/>
		 Things like refactoring
